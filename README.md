# ðŸ§  NLP Portfolio â€“ Student Projects in Natural Language Processing

This repository contains a series of NLP assignments I completed as part of my AI studies. Each notebook demonstrates different NLP techniques and machine learning models using real-world data and tasks.
IMPORTANT: These are not my own projects, and given to me by my practical class supervisor!
